        	<h3>ABOUT US:</h3>
          <p>Today’s business environment presents new risks and challenges every day. And the business owners do not get time to concentrate or focus on un-important tasks. Therefore they have to outsource such tasks. Businesses who want to stay competitive in today’s fast-moving environment are partnering with companies who can provide accounts &amp; finance services and deliver them efficiently. So that the owners can concentrate on the main/ core business more efficiently and subsequently making more profits for their companies. Since today’s business environment presents new risks and challenges every day and the business owners require proper finance guidance, “ACCFIN SERVICES” was founded with the idea that Large sized companies are not the only companies that can benefit from experienced financial professionals. It recognized the fact that smaller and medium sized companies, require a higher level of financial management expertise so that they are not required to hire any high paid financial staff on a full-time basis.</p>

          <p><stong>R.B. Warang has set a high standard for the level of expertise, skill and experience. His 25+ years of experience began with 12 years experience in a medium sized Group in Gulf. In the early years he could use his unique combination of expertise &amp; experiences to work in the Head Office of Group of companies. .He got an opportunity to learn about many different unit companies in many different industries. He learned primarily to be an accounts &amp; finance person  and also to be a commercial person. That experience period helped him develop an understanding, of the factors that help a business to succeed.</p>

          <p>There after R.B. Warang moved and joined another reputed private Group where he continued his business experience in both small and medium scaled companies. There were around 25 companies in a various broad range of industries including manufacturing, industrial processing, consumer products, and consumer services. He had been Group Finance Head (CFO) for both the Groups he worked for. This is typical of the experience and expertise you can expect from your “ACCFIN SERVICES”.</p>
