           <p>Many businesses may not hire a Financial Controller/Manager because the salary cost is prohibitive. Many times the Small and Medium sized business do not have the Finance expertise and guidance for their business. </p>
           <p>
            <p>Our scalable business model allows you to leverage Financial Controller / Manager services when needed during key periods and then scale back this service during non-peak periods, at your discretion. And it can be customized to fit your needs.</p>
